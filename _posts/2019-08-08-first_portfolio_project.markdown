I'm really excited to have completed the first project! Mostly I'm glad because now I actually have something to put in a portfolio! 

The thing I found the most challenging was how to structure the menu in the terminal and how to present that structure to the user in a thoughtful way. When I first started coding it, the structure wasn't very clear so the code never ran the way I expected (and I could never actually exit the program -- so many loops in loops!). I had to stop, sketch out how I wanted it to look, and then completely restructure the code.

I think the code still could use lots of improvement, so I am eager to get feedback on the project. I also keep thinking of new functionality I want to add to it, so this project will be a fun testing ground to play with new ideas. I really enjoyed the creative aspect of this project, and it was easy to get caught up in thinking of more and more features to add.


Going forward, I will definitely *start* projects by sketching out how I want them to look beforehand, and how each step will interact with previous steps. This was a really challenging experience, and it's been amazing to see how much we've already learned in less than a month.
