I am feeling incredibly empowered and excited about this career change to software engineering. We're only on week two of the Software Engineering track, but I am loving the problem solving and puzzle-like aspect of the labs. I love learning new things, and I am very excited about a career in which I'll constantly be challenged to learn more.

Before this, I was working as an Arctic researcher, spending several months of the year living in a tent on the remote tundra. Although this was exciting and challenging work, I needed to find a job that allowed me to be fully present for my family in the U.S. In order to stay connected to biology, I then took a job in science administration.

This job was primarily managerial, and I quickly began to miss the analytical and creative sides of my work. I started spending nights and weekends learning about Python, HTML, and CSS. I took on work projects that involved website editing and updating. Finally, it occurred to me that I could code as a full-time job! 

It was hard to admit that it was time to leave biology, but after much careful thought I realized that software engineering has everything I was looking for in a career: lifelong learning, problem solving, creativity, and flexibility. I am very much looking forward to this chapter of life!
