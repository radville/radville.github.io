Now that I've almost completed the second project, and I'm feeling really impressed by how much we've learned in such a short time. I created a web app where users can save their bird sightings and see them all in one place. 

The curriculum set us up really well for knowing how to create a Sinatra app that handles user logins, so it was fairly easy to get started. I still want to tweak a few things - for example, making my `sesssion: "secret"`  more secret- but I'll come back to those things later. I've found that one of the hardest parts of this is to just let the project be done. I keep thinking of new things I'd like to add.

The hardest part of my project was figuring out how to create a search bar where you can search the database for a specific bird (by name, order, family, or scientific name). It took me a really long time to figure it out, but now I think that's one of the best features.

I'm excited that we can move on to Rails now!
